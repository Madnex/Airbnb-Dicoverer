# Information

## Data
This app allows you to interactively discover data from Airbnb. The available data is from the year 2019/2020. The data source is: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
The data for points of interest comes from http://www.slipo.eu/?p=1551

It can be easily extended to more cites. The only limitation is your RAM. The only version of this app (https://madnex.shinyapps.io/Airbnb/) is limited to 1GB RAM. This is why some big cities would by themselves demand most of  the RAM here and only some "minor" cities are shown.
